pyljvim(post)

pyljvim(post) is a couple of vim macros and one python script to
simplify posting to your LiveJournal from within vim.

Requirements: 
	python, vim :) I don't know if it'll work in old python and vim,
	I did tested it in python 2.2 and vim 6.1 environment.
	If you manage to run this with python 1.5.2 and vim 5.x -- 
	let me know, I'll be happy (but you really should upgrade :).

Installation:
	No fancy install script is available, hand-operation mode.
	Possible installation scenario:
	
	tar -xzf pyljvim-0.0.1.tar.gz
	cd pyljvim-0.0.1
	cp syntax/lj.vim ~/.vim/syntax/
	cp macros/pyljpost.vim ~/.vim/macros/
	cp src/pyljpost.py /usr/local/bin/
	mkdir ~/.pyljvim
	mkdir ~/.pyljvim/templates
	cp templates/* ~/.pyljvim/templates
	echo "source ~/.vim/macros/pyljpost.vim" >> ~/.vimrc
	echo 'let g:pyljpost_path = "/usr/local/bin/pyljpost.py"' >> ~/.vimrc 

Configuration variables
	g:pyljpost_path 	-- path to pyljpost.py, include the "pyljpost.py"
						   itself.
	g:pyljpost_templates_path -- path to templates
	g:pyljpost_encoding -- your terminal encoding, from which to encode to utf-8

	g:pyljpost_username -- LJ Username
	g:pyljpost_password -- LJ Password 
	^^^^^
	These two, if not setted, would be asked upon the post.

Usage
	Once the macros is sourced, two new functions become available,
	LJTemplate and LJPost.

	LJTemplate [template-name]
		This function creates a new buffer, load template <template-name> 
		(standart, if not given), creates the Date: field (if present in
		template), and goes to append mode.
	Once you're ready with your immortal thoughts, goes 
	LJPost
		This function does the actual posting and deletes the buffer and the
		temporary file.

Of course, both functions can be mapped to Your-Beloved-Key.
You can easily create new templates (by writing new files at template_path),
with your own parameters. Full list of available parameters is in "extended"
template. Please note that "Subject" header is required in order to
post.
